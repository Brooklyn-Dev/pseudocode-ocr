# Pseudocode OCR

Opinionated syntax highlighter based off of the OCR Computer Science A-level [Specification](https://www.ocr.org.uk/images/170844-specification-accredited-a-level-gce-computer-science-h446.pdf#page=37).

This extension aims to improve the experience of students taking the OCR Computer Science A-level, by providing syntax highlighting for pseudocode written during the design section of the NEA.

It tries to stay faithful to the specification, but provides some generic highlighting for undocumentated syntax: e.g. block comments (`/* */`), bitwise operators (`XOR`, `LSHIFT`, `RSHIFT`), modifiers (`static`, `const`), if-statements (`elif`), control statements (`continue`, `break`), constants (`null`, `undefined`)
